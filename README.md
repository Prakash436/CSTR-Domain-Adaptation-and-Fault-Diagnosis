# CSTR-Domain-Adaptation-and-Fault-Diagnosis

### Fault Diagnosis is a cornerstone in modern statistical process control, allowing computers to automatically determine which type of fault has occurred from measured signals.

### This datasets contains a set of simulations of a known benchmark in the fault diagnosis for chemical processes community, i.e., the Continuous Stirred Tank Reactor. This system carries an exothermic reaction A -> B, and a feedback loop for controlling the reactor's temperature. There are 7 measured variables,

#### ->Concentration of A in the inlet flow,
->Temperature of the inlet flow,
->Temperature of the inlet coolant flow,
->Coolant flow-rate,
->Concentration of B in the outlet flow,
->Temperature of the outlet flow,
->Temperature of the outlet coolant flow.

The goal is to predict a set of 12 faults from these 7 variables, measured throughout 200 minutes, at a 1 minute rate.
